      Learn how to make meatballs with this recipe that is the best meatball
      recipe I have ever tried! I've used the combination of pork, beef, and
      veal but you can make them with just ground beef and they still taste
      great. Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese
      instead of using the canned variety... It really does make a difference!

        ><span
          >This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and
          ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on
          hand.</span

      <li>
        <strong>Seasonings and herbs: </strong

        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs: </strong
        ><span
          >Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding
          agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese: </strong
        ><span
          >You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid
          the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Italian Bread: </strong
        ><span
          >Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft,
          try letting it sit out overnight.</span
        >/li>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Water: </strong
        ><span
          >Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll
          keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use
          milk.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Olive Oil: </strong><span>Fry the meatballs in olive oil.</span>
      </li>

    <h3>How to Make Meatballs step-by-step</h3>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this
      top-rated meatball recipe:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the first eight ingredients in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the bread crumbs and slowly add the water.</li>
      <li>Shape the mixture into meatballs.</li>
      <li>Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How long to Cook Meatballs</h3>
    <p>
      Cook the meatballs in batches, making sure you don't crowd the pan. It
      should take about 20 minutes, give or take, for the meatballs to be
      perfectly crisp and cooked through. Test their temperature first to be
      sure they're done (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of
      the meatball should read at least 165 degrees F).

      refrigerator for up to four days.

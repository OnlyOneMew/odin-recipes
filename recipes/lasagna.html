    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong>
        <p>
          This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
          beef.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong>
        <p>
          An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons
          of flavor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong>
        <p>
          You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and
          two cans of tomato paste.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong>
        <p>
          Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the
          flavor of the sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>
        <p>
          This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil
          leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong>
        <p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong>
        <p>
          Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra
          decadent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong>
        <p>
          An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
          when you cut into it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>

      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
